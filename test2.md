##Ticket Owners - When Is Your Student Leaving Campus?


##Ticket Opening
Collect as much information as you can when you open a ticket and need to escalate (use INC0229893 as bad example). When dealing with network issues, we need to collect MAC addresses

##Residential College Support

Incorrect
>We are participating in a pilot program to support more folks in your residential college. Specifically, we now support the personal devices of your Master, Dean, any Fellows, and their families. We don't expect too much traffic from them.

Note: this does applies only to their personal machines, not to any work or office computers.
